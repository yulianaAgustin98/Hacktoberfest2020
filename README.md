Hi there,
Thank you for your interest in Hacktoberfest and in helping others make their first contributions to open source.

While we agree that it's important to help others, this repository does not do this in a way that is in line with the Hacktoberfest values. Please read the part that talks about high-quality contributions to understand why we are reaching out and taking action. Due to this, we've added this repository to the list of excluded repositories which means pull requests here will not count toward Hacktoberfest 2020.

This is not a DigitalOcean decision, it's one that is inspired by the community of maintainers and contributors who all agree that quality is more important than quantity when it comes to engagement in the Open Source community. The values remind us to shift the focus from contributions to repositories that encourage folks to quickly create and gain a pull request to contributions that will help people level-up their skills and contribute to open-source projects that are in need of help.

If you feel that this repository is an effective learning resource, we encourage you to keep running it since a core part of the aim for Hacktoberfest is to encourage new folks to get involved with open-source.

However, if you are interested in having contributions to this repo count toward Hacktoberfest we encourage you to take a look at this list of Hacktoberfest issues for inspiration and make the necessary changes to focus on enabling people to make meaningful contributions to open source projects.

If you have any questions about this or participating in Hacktoberfest, please contact our team via email hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com or join our community Discord server.

Happy Hacking,
The Hacktoberfest Team

Hacktoberfest is presented by DigitalOcean, Intel and DEV.
